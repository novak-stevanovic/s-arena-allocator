# SArena

__SArena__ is a tiny C header-only library that provides a simple to use arena allocator.

# Usage:

Include the header in your project and define the implementation macro where needed. 

To install globally, use `make install PREFIX={prefix}`. This will place the header files inside `{prefix}/include/sarena`. By default, `PREFIX=/usr/local`.
